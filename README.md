# DialogSystem

In this assignment I made a dialog system in Unreal Engine 4.

## Features
- Blueprints
- Unreal Engine 4

## Software analysis 
I decided to do this project in UE4 since I want to get better with blueprints. and blueprints are easy to edit for everyone (artists and programmers).

## Learning Goals 
- How to use the UE4 engine
- How to make stuff using Blueprints in UE4
- How does one create an easy editable Dialog System

## Planning (how does one fill in this table?!)
